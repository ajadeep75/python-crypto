Cryptography using Python
          This code deals using Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."

Encryption - It is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.

Decryption - It is the process of transforming data that has been rendered unreadable through encryption back to its unencrypted form. In decryption, the system extracts and converts the garbled data and transforms it to texts and images that are easily understandable not only by the reader but also by the system.
